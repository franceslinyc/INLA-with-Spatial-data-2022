# INLA-with-Spatial-data-2022
Final project for ST559 Bayesian Statistics at OSU

Frances Lin

## Description 

Expand the INLA algorithm (a fast alternative to MCMC methods for Bayesian inference) and include spatial examples of leukemia incident cases (areal data) and heavy metal concentrations (geostatistical data) using the **R** package `R-INLA`.
